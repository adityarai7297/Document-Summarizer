# Text-Summarizer
An automatic Text Summarizer which reads an Annual Report and highlights the important statements and figures automatically for the reader.

Using NLTK and SciKit Learn
to build a Term Document Matrix for any files you want to use for training 
assign Tf-Idf scores to each word present in the corpus
then assigning each sentence a score based on the tf-idf scores of the words in it.

I have also programmed the output to highlight import sentences from the orignal article for ease of readability.
